THIS IS MY PERSONAL TODO LIST
NONE OF THESE IDEAS, PIECES OF SOFTWARE, OR TODOS ARE SET IN STONE, THEY MAY NEVER MAKE THEIR WAY INTO HBUPDATER

todo:
    fix search bar to update every character -> only do something when sb.get() returns non-null

    move more stuff to style.py

Priority:
    (Highest to lowest)
    High:
        Create test function script
        settings:
            ftp tool
        features:
            warn user when no json was downloaded
    Medium:
        features:
            Home page features:
            Buton to open backups folder
            implement auto-injection, (one kinda needs the other)
            option to not clean-install
    Low:
        on-the-fly toggle off infobox
       
        navbox moved to pagetemplate
        file structure:
            clean up imports

        HBUpdater updater
            use github api (duh)
            "skip this version" button
            use yes/no screen when new update is available (disable screen in settings)
        pattern-based payloads
        move folders definitions to guisettings.json

        Dangerous things:
            settings menu button to delete userrepos.json and guisettings.json

    Code clean-up:
    move cfw install code to core (god damn this scene's releases are inconsistent)
    move infobox class to pagetemplate

    Aesthetic:
        borderless window, settings on top bar with quick-access
        fix linux icon
        implement gross light theme

    cleanup todo

Prerelease checklist 
Try:
    Nut
    Fluffy
    Fusee
    inject
    Serial Checker
    Install
    Uninstall
    add repo
    make backup

ongoing:
No releases (Issue created on github)
    Python:
        https://gbatemp.net/threads/pynx-game-redirector.507726/
    Homebrew:
        https://github.com/Chrs2324/SSBUStageInjector
    Tools:
        https://github.com/friedkeenan/GoldtreePy
To add:
    
    https://github.com/Marice/ScreenTester-NX/releases <- Inconsistent release format but it will work due to flexible handling
    https://github.com/colin969/switch-reader/releases
    https://github.com/SilentFlyBy/Blobby-Volley-2-Switch/releases
    https://github.com/ELY3M/Lighting-up-LED-on-right-joycon-for-Nintendo-Switch/releases

    https://github.com/Manurocker95/Evolution-Saved-Me-NX/releases/

todone:
0.8:
    - Projects missing github links will now get one generated from the github api link to go to the github repo, this applies to user-added homebrew as well. 
    - Added titles to pages so you know what you are looking at.
    - Added CFW manager alpha
    - Payload injector page now indicates if injector is already downloaded
    - Title bar now displays app version
0.9:
    - Improved HBUpdaterGUI.py code layout
    - software lists are now populated within the page that uses them, this is more flexible and requires far less code
    - The buttons were getting crowded on the standard homebrew page so I've added a new landing page with big icons. Gives it a metro feel
     - HBUpdater will now check for updates, setting available in setting menu to disable it
    errorpage.py now handles errors and yes/no questions, code reduction in installerhelperpage.py
    - improved folder handling, moved all folder definitions to locations.py
    removed homebrewcore.py to simplify backend
    - added download - on - demand serial checker
    - nut, fluffy, serial checker, payload injector, etc download into a tools subfolder for better folder structure 
    - installerhelperpage's functions have been moved to toolhelper.py in modules, the giu code has been taken over by errorpage.py
0.10
    - added about page, separated from settings
    - stopped crash when initial json fails to download
    - app now works offline
    - app size now set in guisettings_user.json
    - homepage scales better
    - app now writes to .get package location for HBappstore compatibility
    - images are now cached based on author name rather than project name, saving on bandwidth and reducing disc reads  
    - double-click on list pages now executes the set "primary function" of the page (inject payload, install homebrew, restore backup, etc...)
    author images now cache properly in about page
    - install will no longer error if user has removed a file then tried to uninstall it
    - very basic SD card backup tool added
    - user repos now use the pattern system
    - repo jsons now download under the name of the project, this means homebrew that share the same url don't download twice, furthur reducing bandwidth and ratelimit incursion
    - added a session cache to the webhandler so if a repo was already downloaded this session it won't be redownloaded, this is especially useful for users adding multiple assests from the same repo (eg a repo with multiple .nros for different emulators)
    - app now uses the HBAppstore package management system instead of mine, this was a bit annoying to implement (it took longer than I'd like to admit)
1.0-1.1
Release
 - injector now remembers last payload
 - many folders now init only when their corresponding software is downloaded



    
 

bites for official release:
Users already using fluffy or nut will likely already have the prerequsites needed to run this app.
Verified working with pypy
