HBUpdater is a one-stop-shop for managing and updating your Nintendo Switch Homebrew!

  - Includes a lot of popular homebrew
  - Tracks which homebrew version you have installed
  - Downloads directly from github
  - Add your own github repos 
  - No longer visit 17.53 different places to make sure you have the latest version of everything
  - Blawar NUT server integration
  - Easily install past versions of homebrew

# Planned Features:
  - Firmware Manager (I want to be really careful with this one)
  - Default SD Location
  - Version 1.0 will hopefully be compatible with vgamoose's Homebrew Store

# Requirements:
    Works on: Mac, Window, Linux
    Python 3.6 or greater (If you already use nut.py or fluffy you're good)

# How to use:
##### Windows:
- Extract HBUpdater.zip
- Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)
- Double-click startHPUpdater.bat

##### Macintosh:
- Extract HBUpdater.zip
- Mac users may already have a compatible version of python installed, try double-clicking HBUpdater.py
--If the file opens in a text reader, close the reader and right-click the file and open it with pylauncher
- If this still doesn't work, install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)

##### Linux:
- Extract HBUpdater.zip
- Navigate to the directory in a terminal
- Type "python HBUpdaterGUI.py"
- Sometimes python won't ship with tkinter, if you get an error regarding TCL/TK when launching do sudo apt-get install python3-tk
- If you don't know how to do this you should probably be using Windows.
