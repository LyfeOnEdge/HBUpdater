# Requirements:
    Works on: Mac, Window, Linux
    Python 3.6 or greater

# How to use:
##### Windows:
  - Extract HBUpdater.zip
  - Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)
  	- If you do a custom installation remember to install tcl/tk, add python to the path, and include pip
  - In a command prompt type ```pip install pillow pyusb``` to install dependencies
  - Double-click startHBUpdater.bat

##### Macintosh:
- Extract HBUpdater.zip
- Mac users may already have a compatible version of python installed, try double-clicking HBUpdater.py
--If the file opens in a text reader, close the reader and right-click the file and open it with pylauncher
- If this still doesn't work, install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)

##### Linux:
- Extract HBUpdater.zip
- Navigate to the directory in a terminal
- Type "python HBUpdaterGUI.py"
  - If you are missing dependencies do the following:
  - sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-tk python3-pil.imagetk
- If you don't know how to do this you should probably be using Windows.
- For access to USB functions you must run python with elevated privledges (sudo)

## TroubleShooting:
##### Mac:
 - Error:
  - ```ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1056)```
  - Macintosh HD > Applications > Python3.6 folder (or whatever version of python you're using) > double click on "Install Certificates.command" file
