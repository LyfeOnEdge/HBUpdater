 - Argon is a noble gas. "Argon" comes from Greek "Argon", neuter of "argos" meaning lazy , idle or inactive. Argon recieved this name because of its chemical inactivity.

 - Argon NX is an immutable payload which is injected to your Nintendo Switch via Fusee Gelee exploit.

#Purpose
 - The purpose of Argon NX is to stay immutable, so you can always inject it, without caring about other payloads getting updated (Always use ArgonNX for TegraSmash, TegraGUI, TrinkedM0...).

#How can it be immutable?
 - When Argon NX is injected, it automatically launches the payload.bin locacted at argon directory on your SD Card root.

 - If payload.bin is not present or VOLUME DOWN button is pressed on payload injection, Argon NX will list all payloads located at argon/payloads, and you will be able to select one of them to launch it.

Rationale
The YouTube title on the Switch is only usable if one is not banned, since the title in question logs in on Nintendo Network. Whilst it's possible to bypass this by patching the YouTube app, this is far from ideal as the resulting file is not allowed to be shared.

This application aims to circumvent that last problem by launching it's own WifiApplet, meaning no copyrighted data is ever involved.

Desktop mode only (TV mode is inaccessible, Mobile doesn't play videos properly).
Works only from APPLICATION mode (it will display a warning and instructions how to do this if you're still running from APPLET).""",

 - Argon is a noble gas. "Argon" comes from Greek "Argon", neuter of "argos" meaning lazy , idle or inactive. Argon recieved this name because of its chemical inactivity.

 - Argon NX is an immutable payload which is injected to your Nintendo Switch via Fusee Gelee exploit.

#Purpose
 - The purpose of Argon NX is to stay immutable, so you can always inject it, without caring about other payloads getting updated (Always use ArgonNX for TegraSmash, TegraGUI, TrinkedM0...).

#How can it be immutable?
 - When Argon NX is injected, it automatically launches the payload.bin locacted at argon directory on your SD Card root.

 - If payload.bin is not present or VOLUME DOWN button is pressed on payload injection, Argon NX will list all payloads located at argon/payloads, and you will be able to select one of them to launch it.

Still use at your own risk on fat32, but just don't use it on exfat please.\\n\\nIntended for use on Switches that don't have AutoRCM installed.\\n\\nThis uses a new feature added to exosphere in Atmosphere 0.8.1, so it won't work in other CFWs unless they add it in a compatible way. Also Atmosphere 0.8.1 got a silent update with a bug fix to get this feature working, so if you already downloaded it before sometime on 1st Dec you might need to update it again (if it crashes with an orange screen instead of going to RCM, you need to update). There's a commit hash in the filename, make sure you have atmosphere-0.8.1-master-bd76e73 (or if you're living in the future, Atmosphere 0.8.2 or higher will be fine too). It sounds like it currently only works if you load Atmosphere using fusee-primary.bin, not if you use hekate to load Atmosphere as separate files (using hekate to load fusee-primary.bin is ok). This will likely be fixed when hekate is updated.\\n\\nThere are two versions included in the zip, each available as an .nro (put it in its folder inside the \"switch\" folder on the root of your sd card) and as an installable .nsp (install with the stupidly-named installer of your choice).\\n- RCMRebootInstant will reboot to RCM as soon as it loads.\\n- RCMReboot will give you a 5 second countdown with a chance to change your mind.\\n\\nThe reason RCMReboot is a much bigger file than the Instant version is that I used cpasjuste's cross2d library to put stuff on screen, mostly because I've been using it for the other project I'm working on and it saved me time. Sweet library, check it out.\\n\\nCredits to cpasjuste for the aforementioned cross2d, re.lax for nro2nsp (which uses hacbrewpack by the-4n), SciresM for Atmosphere, libnx, and for fixing the bugs in them I found while making this, and everyone else who worked on Atmosphere, libnx, devkitpro and all that good stuff.\\n\\nSource included for peace of mind, and in case of licence requirement. If I've got anything horribly wrong with licensing or credits just let me know. If you want to build it yourself you'll need libnx updated with the latest commit (which isn't in a release build at the time of writing), and to figure out the cross2d setup for the non-Instant version.",

Much of the assembly language was written by Charles Kapps[citation needed], who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\nFeatures :\\n\\n- U can use differents accounts for play.\\n- Highscores\\n- Tactil\\nControls : - Double Touch or D-pad + A : Menu Selection - Short Touch or Short A : enable color - - : Back to menu - : Restart game - Plus : Exit game",
